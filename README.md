# FoodAPI

Containerised (Docker) implementation of an API (ruby) to a PostgreSQL db.

Usage should be as simple as: `docker-compose up`

The db can be populated by sending HTTP requests to the API, which is implemented in Java by www.github.com/maxcoldrick/DatabaseFillerUpper - or you could use the Postman collection: https://www.getpostman.com/collections/71d21d4a010bc0528206
