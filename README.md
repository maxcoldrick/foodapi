# FoodAPI

Demo of using Ruby on Rails to build a RESTful API to an SQLite3 database.

The jist is that Rails gives you the file structure, you give it the values. 

Used https://github.com/stympy/faker to quickly populate the database.

Inspired by a bizarrely easy to follow YouTube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QojnRc7SS9o
